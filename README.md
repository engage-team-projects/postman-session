## üíê Setting Up the Collection

To get the collection ready for the session, do the following:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine. If you need to install Git, follow the instructions provided at the Git website to get started.
2. Open Postman and import the `developer_api_collection.json`. There should be a small import button on the top left.
3. Obtain your API key by following the instructions provided at the [Capital One Hackathon](https://hackathon.capitalone.co.uk/getstarted) website.
4. Once you have your API key, click on the top of your collection (the bit that says `DevAPI Calls`)  and naviagte to the variables section. In there you should see a variable called `apiKey` with no value in. Copy the key from step 3 into here!
